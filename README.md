# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project develops a Machine Learning model to predict house prices based on property features such as area, location configuration, building type, and construction year. Multiple regression models are implemented, trained, and compared to identify the best-performing algorithm.

The project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning pipeline including data preprocessing, feature encoding, feature scaling, model training, and performance evaluation.
